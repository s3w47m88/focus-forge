## Professional Roles
- You are a web application developer.

## Project Context
- You are building a project manager tool.
- The initial version of the tool will be very similar to ToDoIst.

## Technical Specifications
- The application will be built with Next.js
- The application defaults to dark mode.
- The application is mobile-first.
- You will use a next.js frontend design kit that is optimal for admin apps.
- You will rely on file based database for now. We will later transition to Supabase with PostGres.
- The application port is 3244.
- Project 8823 references should be eliminated.

## Development Principles
- Never use temporary solutions.

## Deployment Responsibilities
- You are resposible to check Railway Build and Deploy logs after each deployment. Then debug accordingly.
- Never say something is "fully functional" or "ready to use" always say "Please test."
- Never change user passwords without permission.
- Do not rely on me for testing your solutions.
- Always store .md files in the docs folder, except claude.md

### Development Notes 📝

#### Current State (January 2025)
- Application is functional with file-based storage
- Beginning migration to Supabase for multi-user support
- Auth system partially implemented but not yet connected
- All existing features continue to work during migration

#### Supabase Configuration
- Project created with credentials stored in `.env.local`
- Database schema designed with full RLS policies
- Using @supabase/ssr for Next.js integration
- Service role key available for admin operations

#### User Accounts Plan
1. **Super Administrator**: spencerdhill@protonmail.com (password: REDACTED)
2. **Demo Administrator**: demo@demo.com (password: Demo) - associated with Portland organization
3. Default role for new users: Team Member
4. Users can belong to multiple organizations

#### Migration Strategy
- Incremental migration maintaining current functionality
- Feature flags to switch between file and Supabase adapters
- All existing data will be preserved
- Rollback plan included if needed

#### Security Considerations
- All credentials in `.env.local` (gitignored)
- RLS policies enforce data isolation
- Supabase handles password hashing
- Session-based authentication
- Organization-based data access

#### Next Immediate Steps
1. Run the schema.sql in Supabase dashboard
2. Create the two initial user accounts
3. Begin implementing the data migration script
4. Update API routes one by one to use Supabase
5. Test authentication flow end-to-end

#### Important Files Created
- `/lib/supabase/client.ts` - Browser Supabase client
- `/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server Supabase client
- `/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` - TypeScript types

- Working on Supabase migration Phase 1 (completed)

#### Known Issues
- npm audit shows 1 critical vulnerability (not addressed)

- Some TypeScript types may need updates for Supabase

#### Architecture Decisions
- Using Next.js app router
- Tailwind CSS for styling

- Shadcn/ui components
- File-based DB transitioning to Supabase
- React Context for state management
- Server-side rendering where possible
