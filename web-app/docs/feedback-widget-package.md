# Feedback Widget NPM Package

## Project Overview
An NPM package that displays an icon on any web app, allowing users to log visual notes/feedback that are viewable in Focus: Forge.

## Status
**In Progress** - Requirements gathering phase

---

## Requirements Discussion

### Confirmed Requirements

#### Auto-Capture Features
- Current page URL
- Page title
- App name
- Screenshot of the page

#### Visual Annotation System
- User can place a dot/marker anywhere on the page
- Dot indicates the exact location of feedback
- Developer view: navigates to that page and shows animated dot (growing/shrinking pulsing effect)
- Clicking the dot reveals notes in a chat bubble

#### Architecture
- Lightweight NPM package
- Separate app from Focus: Forge
- Interfaces with Focus: Forge via API
- Built with Next.js

## Open Questions

### Question 2 (Pending Answer)
**What fields should the note/feedback form contain?**

Options discussed:
- Just a text field for their note
- Text field + category dropdown (bug, suggestion, question, praise)
- Text field + priority/severity selector
- Text field + their name/email (for follow-up)
- Something else

*Awaiting response...*

### Future Questions to Ask
- Authentication: How should apps authenticate with Focus: Forge API?
- User identification: Anonymous users or require some identifier?
- Storage: Where do screenshots get stored? (Supabase storage, S3, etc.)
- Developer dashboard: New section in Focus: Forge or separate view?
- Real-time: Should developers see feedback in real-time or on refresh?
- Package name: What should the NPM package be called?
- Icon placement: Where should the feedback icon appear by default? (corner, floating, etc.)
- Icon customization: Should the icon be customizable per-app?
